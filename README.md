This is an engineering project to build a sisyphus table like kinetic art table.


First stage of the project is to build a 2 link planar robotic arm. The arm will have a working area of 360 degrees with a radius of 290 mm.
Parts have been designed with Fusion 360 by me where the inspiration and help came from [grammesm](https://alwaystinkering.com/2020/01/14/diy-kinetic-sand-art-table/). 
For the axis I noticed that plastic was not rigid enough. So I used 8 mm aluminium rod to fit through skateboard bearings. Gear ratio I used is 20/60 where the belt lenghts are 158 mm for the first axis and 400 mm for the 140.5 mm arm.
